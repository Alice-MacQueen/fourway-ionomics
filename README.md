Analysis and manuscript contributions for ionomics QTL analysis for the *P. virgatum* four-way cross.

This repository will contain Li's code and analysis needed to analyze the 2016 ionomics data collected for the switchgrass four-way cross. 

It will also contain Alice's writeup of this analysis.

This repository is currently private, but will be made public when the manuscript that uses these analyses is published.

# The four-way ionomics manuscript 

## Study system: The switchgrass four-way population
*P. virgatum* is a long-lived perennial grass. It provides ecosystem services - it can interrupt pest life cycles, manage water flows, provide carbon sequestration, improve soil quality and provide erosion control. It can also enhance environmental quality - it can reduce pesticide loads and provide pollinator & wildlife habitat.

In this study, we expand the scope of local adaptation research in ionomics by evaluating its genetic basis in outcrossing perennial switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) across 10 field sites, covering 17° of latitude (1,866 km) in the central United States (Fig. 1). The mapping population used in this study combined the genetic variation of three switchgrass cultivars and one wild accession. Switchgrass cultivars are derived from natural populations and unlike most crop species are only a few generations removed from those wild collections (24). Clones of the same outbred four-way genetic mapping population were planted at each site, which allowed us to evaluate the contributions of individual loci to traits and fitness over a wide range of climatic conditions. The grandparents of the mapping population were derived from highly divergent southern lowland and northern upland ecotypes (25). The southern lowland ecotype of switchgrass is typically found in riparian areas of the southern United States, produces large amounts of biomass, and is more nutrient-use-efficient, heat-tolerant, pathogen-resistant, and flooding-tolerant than the northern upland ecotype (26–30). However, the northern upland ecotype is typically more freezing-tolerant than the southern lowland ecotype (31–35). Flowering time in switchgrass, a trait correlated with biomass production, follows a strong latitudinal pattern, where flowering time becomes progressively
later in more southern populations (29, 36–38). (Lowry *et al.*, 2019)

## Ionomics
The ionome is defined as the mineral nutrient and trace element composition of an organism and represents the inorganic component of cellular and organismal systems. Ionomics, the study of the ionome, involves the quantitative and simultaneous measurement of the elemental composition of living organisms and changes in this composition in response to physiological stimuli, developmental state, and genetic modifications. Ionomics requires the application of high-throughput elemental analysis technologies and their integration with both bioinformatic and genetic tools. Ionomics has the ability to capture information about the functional state of an organism under different conditions, driven by genetic and developmental differences and by biotic and abiotic factors. The relatively high throughput and low cost of ionomic analysis means that it has the potential to provide a powerful approach to not only the functional analysis of the genes and gene networks that directly control the ionome, but also to the more extended gene networks that control developmental and physiological processes that affect the ionome indirectly. (Salt *et al.*, 2008).

# Alice's contributions

Currently, I plan to write the first draft of the manuscript based on Li's analysis of the ionomics data.
