Ionomics and the study of the Plant Ionome

What had been found using RILs in 2008: they had identified QTL for several ionomic traits in A. thaliana, rice, and maize. In A. thaliana these traits include phosphate accumulation in seed and shoot (11), shoot Cs accumulation (65), shoot selenate accumulation (97), seed K, Na, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, and P accumulation (86), and sulfate accumulation (49). In rice and maize these traits include P, Si, Na, and K accumulation (43,
48, 73, 92, 93).

## Plant Ionomics: From Elemental Profiling to Environmental Adaptation

Ionomics can be applied to investigate the ecological functions of ionomic alleles in adaptation to the environment.

In an analysis of the leaf ionome of many thousands of A. thaliana plants, only 11% of the mutants identified showed alterations in a single element, supporting the concept that ionomic networks in plants are coordinately regulated and need to be viewed as a whole. This concept has been recently reviewed (Baxter 2015). 

Ionomic studies have now been performed in many plant species, including rice, maize barley, soybean, Lotus japonica, tomato, and others (Watanabe et al 2007; White et al 2012; Parent et al 2013). Also in yeast, humans, and animals. `However, although variation between grass & other species has been consdiered, and variation within annual plant species has been considered, variation within perennial grass species has not yet been considered.`

Previous genetic studies of local adaptation in the field have been restricted in their generalizability for multiple reasons (5). Many of these studies were of short duration or focused on a limited environmental range. As a consequence, these studies
cannot rule out the possibility that trade-offs were undetected because of insufficient sample sizes, inadequately sampled environmental conditions, or environmental variability among years (21, 22). These studies have also been primarily restricted to biparental crosses in annual plant species that are predominantly self-fertilizing. The low outcrossing rates and/or patchy distributions of these species could provide mechanisms for the evolution of locally adaptive alleles that have positive effects in one population without spreading to other populations by gene flow (4, 5, 23). Further, experiments to date have primarily relied only on two field sites, often at the extreme ends of environmental gradients (5). Without finer-scale analyses of genetic effects across geographic space, it is not possible to determine how the fitness contributions of individual loci change across environmental gradients. Studies that expand the genetics of local adaptation research to more than two field sites, to out-
breeding perennial species, and with crosses involving more parents have the potential to clarify the extent to which there are benefits and cost of locally adaptive loci. 

In this study, we expand the scope of local adaptation research
by evaluating its genetic basis in outcrossing perennial switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) across 10 field sites, covering 17° of latitude (1,866 km) in the central United States (Fig. 1). The mapping population used in this study combined the genetic variation of three switchgrass cultivars and one wild accession. Switchgrass cultivars are derived from natural populations and unlike most crop species are only a few generations removed from those wild collections (24). Clones of the same outbred four-way genetic mapping population were planted at each site, which allowed us to evaluate the contributions of individual loci to traits and fitness over a wide range of climatic conditions. The grandparents of the mapping population were derived from highly divergent southern lowland and northern upland ecotypes (25). The southern lowland ecotype of switchgrass is typically found in riparian areas of the southern United States, produces large amounts of biomass, and is more nutrient-use-efficient, heat-tolerant, pathogen-resistant, and flooding-tolerant than the northern upland ecotype (26–30). However, the northern upland ecotype is typically more freezing-tolerant than the southern lowland ecotype (31–35). Flowering time in switchgrass, a trait correlated with biomass production, follows a strong latitudinal pattern, where flowering time becomes progressively
later in more southern populations (29, 36–38).

The abundance of different elements in leaves tends to decrease as a function of atomic mass (Markert, 1987); all essential elements except Mo have an atomic number ≤ 30. 

We analysed 2228 leaf samples from 670 species of terrestrial plants, representing 138 families. All species were assigned to 30 ‘key clades’, which represent monophyletic groups at relatively high taxonomic levels following recent phylogenetic insights (Pryer et al., 2001; Soltis et al., 2005), including Bryophytes, Lycopodiophytina, Polypodiophytina, Equisetophytina, Ginkgoales, Pinales, Cycadales, Austrobaileyales, Alismatales, Dioscoreales + Pandanales, Liliales, Asparagales, Commelinids, Magnoliids, Ranunculales, Sabiaceae, Proteales, Berberidopsidales, Caryophyllales, Santalales, Saxifragales, Vitales, Crossosomatales, Myrtales, Eurosids I, Eurosids II, Cornales, Ericales, Euasterids I, and Euasterids II (Fig. 1). 

Multivariate correlations in the leaf concentration of elements among species have been identified previously. For example, among 43 herbaceous species, variation in 67 mature plant traits associated with variation in leaf‐N, P, Ca, K and Mg. A metabolically active ‘nucleic acid‐protein’ set of leaf elements, comprising leaf‐N, P, Cu, Fe and S, forms associations distinct from structural and enzymatic sets of leaf elements, including leaf Ca, K and Mg (Garten, 1976, 1978). Thus, we show here for the first time that higher‐level phylogenetic effects influence the leaf composition of a wide range of elements, including elements with quantitatively lesser roles than N in metabolism, and elements that are nonessential for plant growth. Most of the leaf elements measured in this study are likely to localize quantitatively to structural (cell‐wall) or osmotic (vacuolar) fractions of leaf tissues. 

Did a variance components analysis of variation in concentration of 42 mineral elements across sites, key clades, families, species, (& residual). Table 1. Worth a look.

The low grain iron and zinc densities are well documented problems in food crops,
affecting crop nutritional quality especially in cereals.



Three micronutrients iron (Fe), zinc (Zn) and provitamin A are widely
deficient, especially among low economic group population in
developing countries. Fe and Zn deficiencies are most prevalent
with almost over three billion people affected word wide (Welch
and Graham, 2004). Nearly 500,000 children (<5 years of age)
die annually because of Zn and Fe deficiencies (Black et al., 2008).
Among the 26 major risk factors of the global burden of disease
estimates, iron deficiency ranks 9th, while zinc, and vitamin
A deficiencies ranks at 11th and 13th positions, respectively
(Ezzati et al., 2002). Deficiency of iron and zinc results in poor
growth, reduced immunity, fatigue, irritability, weakness, hair
loss, wasting of muscles, sterility, morbidity and even death in
acute cases (Haas and Brownlie, 2001; Pfeiffer and McClafferty,
2007; Stein, 2010).

Soil micronutrient status vary greatly in dry lands where
sorghum cultivation is concentrated, under such conditions,
genotype × environment (G × E) interaction for agronomic
and grain nutrient traits expect to be large and may not permit
differentiation of performance of genotypes across environments.

Switchgrass ionomics paper - 20 elements in 31 switchgrass accessions. Midseason and late season harvest in one year at one location. (looking at remobilization efficiency).

The concentration of
several elements (N, P, K, and Rb) decreased in the shoots
of all accessions during senescence, although the efficiency of remobilization ranged from 20% to 61% for N, 31% to
65% for P, 25% for 84% for K, and 33% to 84% for Rb.


Finally,
differences in elemental composition between upland and
lowland ecotypes were also found. 

## This paper has good ionomics justifications for biofuels.

Although switchgrass remobilizes some nutrients from
shoots to roots each year during senescence, substantial
amounts of nutritive elements are removed with harvested
biomass. For example, the total N removed with biomass in
a one-cut fall harvest system varied from 31 to 63 kg N
−1 −1 −1 −1ha year , and from 90 to 144 kg ha year for a two-
cut system, over 5 years of measurements [26]. Such
nutrient withdrawal rates inevitably result in N depletion
from the soil and necessitate the addition of fertilizer N to
maintain switchgrass productivity. Synthesis and applica-
tion of fertilizer N is energy intensive and economically and
environmentally costly. High N content in harvested
biomass can be an additional liability because it yields
NOx compounds upon oxidation, which are potent atmo-
spheric pollutants [15]. High concentrations of other
macronutrients such as P, K, and S in harvested biomass
can lead to significant depletion of these in the soil,
necessitating fertilizer amendments to maintain soil fertility.
Finally, the presence of certain elements in biomass,
especially alkali metals, can negatively affect biomass
digestion, fermentation, or combustion [21]. This will also
increase the cost of bioenergy production.

Nutrient management is a key component of sustainable
agriculture. Nutrient uptake from the soil is not only
primarily a function of plant biomass but it is also
influenced by plant genotype and environment interactions,
especially soil properties, weather, and management prac-
tices [27]. One reason that switchgrass was selected as a
promising species for biofuel production is that it can be
grown on marginal soils, which would minimize competi-
tion with food crops for prime arable land [6, 25].
Nonetheless, sustainable management of soil nutrients and
fertilizers will be important if switchgrass is to become part
of a long-term solution to the looming energy crisis.
Nutrients are always removed from the soil when biomass
is harvested and taken away from the site of production.
However, the amount of each element removed depends on
the plant species, genotype, time of harvest, and other
factors. Time of harvest is particularly important for
perennial plants, such as switchgrass, which remobilize
some nutrients during shoot senescence and store them in
the root for subsequent re-use during shoot growth in the
next season [15, 25]. Diversity exists within and among
natural populations of plants both in the timing of

Despite the fact that lowland ecotypes were, on average,
more efficient in their use of N and P to produce biomass

While the use of natural variation in classical
breeding programs is one sure way to reduce nutrient losses
with harvested biomass, biotechnology and precise gene
transfer are alternative approaches that may extend what is
possible using natural variation alone [8, 19].

At least two systems for switchgrass harvesting have
been tested: one-cut in late fall/early winter and two-cut in
both mid-summer and late fall. Although the one- and two-
cut systems often produce similar yields [17], the two-cut
system was shown to remove more nutrients from soil than
the one-cut system [14–16]. Consistent with such results,
the concentration of N, P, and K in mature tillers harvested
in August were higher than those of senescence tillers
harvested in December for all 31 accessions in our study
Bioenerg. Res. (2009) 2:257–266
 265
(Tables 1 and 2). Thus, a single harvest in late fall/early
winter would conserve more soil nutrientsv for subsequent
biomass production.

 We found significant
differences between the two ecotypes classes in Ca and
Mg contents at the maturity stage, in N and P contents at
the senescent stage, and K and Na at both developmental
stages (Table 4).  These results indicated that there are
elemental differences between upland and lowland ecotypes
grown in the field. In view of the fact that K and Na
homeostasis are closely related to plant salt tolerance [28,
32], it will be interesting to test if the higher levels of K and
Na in lowland ecotypes make them more or less susceptible
to salt stress. Except for a mention that lowland Alamo has
moderate tolerance to salinity [2], no other information
about salt tolerance of switchgrass ecotypes is available in
the literature, to our knowledge. Given the likelihood that
switchgrass will be planted on marginal soils, including
saline soils, this is an area of research well worth pursuing.

We do genetic mapping of the ionome in switchgrass. To our knowledge, this is the first genetic study of the ionome in switchgrass. Ionomic differences were known to exist between upland and lowland ecotypes, and we map this divergence here.
We also map the ionome of switchgrass in three environments within its native range, separated by 14 degrees of latitude.
