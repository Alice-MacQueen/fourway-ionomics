Ionomics and the study of the Plant Ionome

What had been found using RILs in 2008: they had identified QTL for several ionomic traits in A. thaliana, rice, and maize. In A. thaliana these traits include phosphate accumulation in seed and shoot (11), shoot Cs accumulation (65), shoot selenate accumulation (97), seed K, Na, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, and P accumulation (86), and sulfate accumulation (49). In rice and maize these traits include P, Si, Na, and K accumulation (43,
48, 73, 92, 93).

Major genes known to be involved in regulating the ionome at this point: the Na-transporter HKT1. The gene Adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate reductase, a central enzyme in sulfate assimilation. And an ionomic mutant in which low shoot Ca is driven by perturbations in root cell wall structure (unpublished).

## Plant Ionomics: From Elemental Profiling to Environmental Adaptation

Ionomics can be applied to investigate the ecological functions of ionomic alleles in adaptation to the environment.

In an analysis of the leaf ionome of many thousands of A. thaliana plants, only 11% of the mutants identified showed alterations in a single element, supporting the concept that ionomic networks in plants are coordinately regulated and need to be viewed as a whole. This concept has been recently reviewed (Baxter 2015). 

Ionomic studies have now been performed in many plant species, including rice, maize barley, soybean, Lotus japonica, tomato, and others (Watanabe et al 2007; White et al 2012; Parent et al 2013). Also in yeast, humans, and animals. `However, although variation between grass & other species has been consdiered, and variation within annual plant species has been considered, variation within perennial grass species has not yet been considered.`

Previous genetic studies of local adaptation in the field have been restricted in their generalizability for multiple reasons (5). Many of these studies were of short duration or focused on a limited environmental range. As a consequence, these studies
cannot rule out the possibility that trade-offs were undetected because of insufficient sample sizes, inadequately sampled environmental conditions, or environmental variability among years (21, 22). These studies have also been primarily restricted to biparental crosses in annual plant species that are predominantly self-fertilizing. The low outcrossing rates and/or patchy distributions of these species could provide mechanisms for the evolution of locally adaptive alleles that have positive effects in one population without spreading to other populations by gene flow (4, 5, 23). Further, experiments to date have primarily relied only on two field sites, often at the extreme ends of environmental gradients (5). Without finer-scale analyses of genetic effects across geographic space, it is not possible to determine how the fitness contributions of individual loci change across environmental gradients. Studies that expand the genetics of local adaptation research to more than two field sites, to out-
breeding perennial species, and with crosses involving more parents have the potential to clarify the extent to which there are benefits and cost of locally adaptive loci. 

In this study, we expand the scope of local adaptation research
by evaluating its genetic basis in outcrossing perennial switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) across 10 field sites, covering 17° of latitude (1,866 km) in the central United States (Fig. 1). The mapping population used in this study combined the genetic variation of three switchgrass cultivars and one wild accession. Switchgrass cultivars are derived from natural populations and unlike most crop species are only a few generations removed from those wild collections (24). Clones of the same outbred four-way genetic mapping population were planted at each site, which allowed us to evaluate the contributions of individual loci to traits and fitness over a wide range of climatic conditions. The grandparents of the mapping population were derived from highly divergent southern lowland and northern upland ecotypes (25). The southern lowland ecotype of switchgrass is typically found in riparian areas of the southern United States, produces large amounts of biomass, and is more nutrient-use-efficient, heat-tolerant, pathogen-resistant, and flooding-tolerant than the northern upland ecotype (26–30). However, the northern upland ecotype is typically more freezing-tolerant than the southern lowland ecotype (31–35). Flowering time in switchgrass, a trait correlated with biomass production, follows a strong latitudinal pattern, where flowering time becomes progressively
later in more southern populations (29, 36–38).

The abundance of different elements in leaves tends to decrease as a function of atomic mass (Markert, 1987); all essential elements except Mo have an atomic number ≤ 30. 

We analysed 2228 leaf samples from 670 species of terrestrial plants, representing 138 families. All species were assigned to 30 ‘key clades’, which represent monophyletic groups at relatively high taxonomic levels following recent phylogenetic insights (Pryer et al., 2001; Soltis et al., 2005), including Bryophytes, Lycopodiophytina, Polypodiophytina, Equisetophytina, Ginkgoales, Pinales, Cycadales, Austrobaileyales, Alismatales, Dioscoreales + Pandanales, Liliales, Asparagales, Commelinids, Magnoliids, Ranunculales, Sabiaceae, Proteales, Berberidopsidales, Caryophyllales, Santalales, Saxifragales, Vitales, Crossosomatales, Myrtales, Eurosids I, Eurosids II, Cornales, Ericales, Euasterids I, and Euasterids II (Fig. 1). 

Multivariate correlations in the leaf concentration of elements among species have been identified previously. For example, among 43 herbaceous species, variation in 67 mature plant traits associated with variation in leaf‐N, P, Ca, K and Mg. A metabolically active ‘nucleic acid‐protein’ set of leaf elements, comprising leaf‐N, P, Cu, Fe and S, forms associations distinct from structural and enzymatic sets of leaf elements, including leaf Ca, K and Mg (Garten, 1976, 1978). Thus, we show here for the first time that higher‐level phylogenetic effects influence the leaf composition of a wide range of elements, including elements with quantitatively lesser roles than N in metabolism, and elements that are nonessential for plant growth. Most of the leaf elements measured in this study are likely to localize quantitatively to structural (cell‐wall) or osmotic (vacuolar) fractions of leaf tissues. 

Did a variance components analysis of variation in concentration of 42 mineral elements across sites, key clades, families, species, (& residual). Table 1. Worth a look.

Group I & II mineral elements have concentrations in leaf concentrations in plant species that are correlated with one another: 
Group I: Na, Rb, Cs, K
Group II: Mg, Sr, Ba, Ca
Sr & Ca: 0.665****
Ca & Mg: 0.357****
Sr & Mg: 0.322***

Rb & K: 0.604****





# Phuke et al., 2017 Genetic Variability, GxE, Correlation, and GGE Biplot Analysis for Grain Iron and Zinc Concentration and Other Agronomic Traits in RIL population of Sorghum



The low grain iron and zinc densities are well documented problems in food crops,
affecting crop nutritional quality especially in cereals.



Three micronutrients iron (Fe), zinc (Zn) and provitamin A are widely
deficient, especially among low economic group population in
developing countries. Fe and Zn deficiencies are most prevalent
with almost over three billion people affected word wide (Welch
and Graham, 2004). Nearly 500,000 children (<5 years of age)
die annually because of Zn and Fe deficiencies (Black et al., 2008).
Among the 26 major risk factors of the global burden of disease
estimates, iron deficiency ranks 9th, while zinc, and vitamin
A deficiencies ranks at 11th and 13th positions, respectively
(Ezzati et al., 2002). Deficiency of iron and zinc results in poor
growth, reduced immunity, fatigue, irritability, weakness, hair
loss, wasting of muscles, sterility, morbidity and even death in
acute cases (Haas and Brownlie, 2001; Pfeiffer and McClafferty,
2007; Stein, 2010).

Soil micronutrient status vary greatly in dry lands where
sorghum cultivation is concentrated, under such conditions,
genotype × environment (G × E) interaction for agronomic
and grain nutrient traits expect to be large and may not permit
differentiation of performance of genotypes across environments.
