# PCE; new phytologist

Ionomic analysis was run on _380_ plants at three locations for 14 elemental compositions. 

Ca44, Se78, Sr88, and Cd111 had bimodal distributions of abundance within the plant samples. Many had to have outlier samples removed `(did these fall into any sort of pattern of site or individual?)`

## Elemental abundance correlations (phenotypic)

Of 18, four elements did not run due to machine errors in detecting elemental concentrations. 2 didn't run due to negative abundances, gave too few values to converge. 2 of the 16 remaining traits had no QTL - As75 & B11 did not have QTL. Co59 & Se78 didn't work due to negative values. 

At CLMB, the majority of elements were not strongly correlated with one another. Ca44 and Sr88 were highly correlated (0.77), as were Co59 and Cu63 (0.57), Fe54 and Al27 (0.51), Mn55 and Sr88 (0.5), Ca and Zn (0.43), Co59 and Fe54 (0.43), and Cu63 and Fe54 (0.44), Al27 and Cu63 (0.44). I believe these are all 2+ elements.

At PKLE, B11 and Sr88 were highly correlated (0.74), Al27 and B11 (0.65), Al27 and Sr88 (0.6), Ca44 with Sr88 and Zn66 (0.55, 0.49), and P31 with Rb85 (0.42).

Phenotypic correlations were typically larger at KBSM than at PKLE or CLMB.
As75 with Se78 (0.64), B11 with Mo98 & Na23 (0.69, 0.58), Ca44 with Sr88 and Zn66 (0.69 and 0.63), Cu63 with P31 (0.43), Fe54 with P31 (0.43), K39 with Rb85 (0.79), Mg26 with Sr88 (0.49), Mn55 with Sr88 (0.45), and P31 with Rb85 (0.41). 

Within sites, all strong (>0.3) correlations were positive. However, when correlations were made across all sites, there were three strong negative correlations: Ca44 and Cd111 (-0.49), Ca44 and Mn55 (-0.47), and Cd111 and Na23 (-0.38). 

`It would be nice to have correlation plots that are rearranged, for ease of interpretation...`

`For the QTL summary plot, the colors are too similar and the key goes off the page - I can't interpret the overlaps. Also, there are some small black dots which don't seem to correlate with any QTL.`

QTL regions on most chromosomes showed QxE. 16 of 18 chromosomes had QTL, and 14 of 18 had QTL with QxE.

## LOD scores

QTL analysis of these elemental compositions found between two and 14 QTL regions above a LOD threshold of `3.5`. 

The largest LOD score was for Cd111 on Chr02K@32.06 `(Mb? what?)`. In the C x D cross, this region had large effects on Cd111 levels at KBSM and CLMB. This QTL overlapped a QTL for Sr88, but this QTL fell into a much wider interval, and barring a mechanism affecting these elements the same way, I doubt these have pleiotropy.

## Overlapping QTL

`The QTL on Chr01N seems to be rendered incorrectly.`

Overall, there were 21 sets of QTL that had overlapping intervals, and 20 QTL that did not overlap another ionomics QTL. Rb85 Chr01K, Mg26 Chr01N, Mg26 on Chr02K, K39 on Chr02N, two P31 QTL on Chr03K, Mg26 on Chr03N, two P31 and a Cu63 on Chr04K, Mg26 on Chr04N, Rb85 on Chr05K, P31, Na23, and Mg26 on Chr05N, Mg26 on Chr07N, Sr88 on Chr08K, Rb85 on Chr08N, Sr88 on Chr09K, and K39 on Chr09N. 

77 QTL total
5 P31 single, 9 overlap
6 Mg26 single, 3 overlap
2 Sr88 single, 7 overlap
3 Rb85 single, 5 overlap
2 K39 single, 5 overlap
0 Ca44 single, 5 overlap
1 Cu63 single, 4 overlap
0 Mn55 single, 5 overlap
0 Al27 single, 4 overlap
0 Zn66 single, 3 overlap
0 Cd111 single, 2 overlap
0 Fe54 single, 2 overlap
0 Mo98 single, 2 overlap
1 Na23 single, 1 overlap

More Mg26 non-overlapping QTL than expected (6, and 2.3 expected). I bet some of these could be related to Mg's essential function in chlorophyll molecules. Has more QTL 
Fewer Ca44 non-overlapping QTL than expected (0, and 1.3 expected), and fewer Al27 non-overlapping QTL than expected (0, 1 expected). I bet Ca might overlap a lot with other 2A elements, or 2+ elements, like Mg, Sr, Zn, even Fe. Not sure about Al...

On Chr01K, there were two sets of overlapping QTL - P31, Cu63, and K39 near 14.42, and Cu63 and P31 near 71-75.
On Chr02K, there was one set of overlapping QTL - Cd111 and Sr88 @ ~32.
Chr02N had three sets of overlapping QTL - Mg26 and P31 from 0-12, Ca44, Sr88, and Zn66 from 20-33, Rb85, P31, and Cd111 from 76-79.
Chr03K had one set of overlapping QTL
Chr03N had one set of overlapping QTL
Chr04N had one set of overlapping QTL
Chr05K had two sets of overlapping QTL
Chr07K had two sets of overlapping QTL
Chr07N had one set of overlapping QTL
Chr08K had one set of overlapping QTL
Chr09K had three sets of overlapping QTL
Chr09N had three sets of overlapping QTL


## Ion functions and/or toxicity

What are major functions for each of these elements in plant cells?
Al Aluminum toxicity is a major constraint for crop production in acidic soil worldwide (Panda, Baluska, Matsumoto 2009). The target of Al toxicity is the root tip, in which Al exposure causes inhibition of cell elongation and cell division, leading to root stunting accompanied by reduced water and nutrient uptake. Al3+ is the most toxic form. Approximately 50% of arable land is negatively impacted by Al toxicity due to acidic soil.
Ca Calcium uptake by the plant is passive and does not require energy input. Calcium uptake is directly related to the plant transpiration rate. COnditions of high humidity, cold, and low transpiration rates may result in calcium deficiency. Calcium promotes proper plant cell elongation, strengthens cell wall structure by forming calcium pectate compounds, helps protect plants against heat stress by improving stomata function and participating in induction of HSPs. Usually soils with higher pH levels contain more available calcium. Calcium competes with other positively charged ions, such as Na+, K+, and Mg2+. 
Cd Cadmium is a environmental pollutant with toxic effects on plants. It can displace essential metals from a wealth of metalloproteins and disturb normal physiological processes and cause severe developmental aberrance. ROS overproduction, chloroplast structure change, cytoskeleton effects, vesicular trafficking effects, cell wall formation effects. Plants have cadmium pumps and transport cadmium into leaf vacuoles.
